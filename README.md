# FEWD-2
Repository for FEWD 2
****** PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ******
●	application must have a responsive design through the use of media queries, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and/or other similar approaches - we need to ensure that you can integrate your new JavaScript skills with your HTML/CSS skills you previously learned. We will test your site on at least two different screen sizes (mobile and desktop) and must see that you’ve incorporated some element of responsive design to it.
●	Project is uploaded to GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits. Using GitHub’s file uploader does not count as a check-in. You must upload via Git command line.
●	Project includes a README file that explains the following:
○	A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is.
○	Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
-FEATURES LIST-
●	Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app
●	Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)
●	Post to an external API and show that it has saved/persisted
○	Example: Use Amazon S3’s API to upload a file to an AWS S3 bucket
●	Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
○	You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that it’s being saved/persisted
●	Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application
●	Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value
●	Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
●	Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
●	Create 3 or more unit tests for your application (and document how to run them)
●	Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
●	Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
●	Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
●	Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
●	Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.

Additional Features you can include but may not be covered by videos/tutorials:
●	Implement a drag-and-drop interface that allows the user to move elements or items on the page around (reference). For example, drag a file or image into the app from your desktop and have it display. 
●	Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, Vue, etc.
●	Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS
●	Other features can be added to this list - just ask if your project needs something specific and as long as it’s a good demonstration of your programming skills, it almost certainly will count!  Basically, we just want to see you do something interesting and challenging, so don’t let these requirements stifle your creativity!

○	Any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project
●	Choose at least 3 items on the FEATURES LIST below and implement them in your project
○	We recommend you pick a 4th item (or more!) to add, just in case something goes wrong with one of your other items - 3 is only the minimum requirement.
